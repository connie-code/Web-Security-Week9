# Project 9 - Honeypot

Time spent: **14** hours spent in total

> Objective: Learn about Network Security by attacking and being attacked at vulnarable networked resources. Multiple Honey Pot VM instances were created to demonstrate it. 

## Which HoneyPot(s) you deployed 
  - mhn-honeypot-1
  - mhn-honeypot-2
  - mhn-honeypot-3

## Any issues you encountered
  > I had issues setting up the VM and getting the external IP address to load. It took a couple tries (redoing from start) to get it to work. 

## A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.
1. Google Cloud and Honeypot GIF setup
    - Google cloud is used to create three honeypot VM ( Ubuntu trusty). MHN server was intalled on mhn-admin VM while other three are being used as honeypot for attacks.
